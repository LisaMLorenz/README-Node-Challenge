### Technical Requirements

* Create a command-line application that accepts user input.
* When a user is prompted for information, a high-quality README.md is created with:
* Project Title, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, Questions
* When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README..
* When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
* When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
* When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.
* When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.
* When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
